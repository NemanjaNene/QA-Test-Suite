# QA Test Suite for E-Commerce & API Testing

## Overview

This repository contains automated test scripts written using Selenium and TestNG for E-commerce functionality testing and JMeter for performance testing. The tests are executed using **IntelliJ IDEA** and **Maven**, and reports are generated using **ExtentReports**.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Java**: Main programming language for writing test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating browser interactions.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework used for structuring test cases.
- **JMeter**: Tool for performance and load testing.
- **ExtentReports**: For generating detailed test execution reports.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool, used to manage dependencies.

### Test Details:

1. **E-commerce Functional Tests** (`EcommerceTest.java`)
    - Tested functionality includes adding items to the cart, checking out, and validating correct prices.
    - ExtentReport HTML file generated for this test: `EcommerceTestReport.html`.

2. **Login Functionality Tests** (`AnanasLoginTest.java`)
    - Tests various login scenarios on Ananas.rs with both valid and invalid email/password combinations.
    - ExtentReport HTML file generated for this test: `LoginTestReport.html`.

3. **API Performance Testing** (`AnanasJMeterTest.java`)
    - JMeter-based API performance testing for the Ananas homepage.
    - HTML performance report generated: `HTML_Report/index.html`.

### Structure:

- **src/test/java**: Contains Java test classes for functional and login tests.
- **Reports**: Contains HTML reports generated by ExtentReports and JMeter.
- **Screenshots**: Captured screenshots from failed tests for easier debugging.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file that includes dependencies for Selenium, TestNG, ExtentReports, and JMeter.

### How to Run the Tests:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/NemanjaNene/QA-Test-Suite.git`

2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.

3. To run functional and login tests:
    - Right-click on the test class (e.g., `EcommerceTest.java` or `AnanasLoginTest.java`).
    - Select **Run**.

4. To run performance tests with JMeter:
    - Open the `jmeter.bat` or `jmeter.sh` (depending on your OS).
    - Open the JMeter `.jmx` file and run the test plan.

5. Reports for test executions will be available in the **Reports** folder.

### Additional Notes:
- The project includes example tests for invalid login attempts and cart functionality, which can be expanded as needed.
- Ensure that **ChromeDriver** is properly installed and that the correct path is set for browser automation.
